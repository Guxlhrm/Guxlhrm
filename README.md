## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me
 I'm Guilherme, a former military member who decided to pursue my dream of becoming a software developer. After years of service, I discovered my true passion in programming, and I am committed to learning, creating, and contributing to amazing projects. I am highly dedicated and disciplined, with excellent communication, teamwork, and adaptability skills. In my free time, I enjoy gaming (I love the challenge of a Soulslike), studying new things, and practicing the guitar. ðŸ¤“
